 * A Counter counts time in some units and in some width, signaling
 * overflow.
 *
 * <p>A Counter is parameterised by its "precision" (milliseconds,
 * microseconds, etc), identified by a type. This prevents, e.g.,
 * unintentionally mixing components expecting milliseconds with those
 * expecting microseconds as those interfaces have a different type.
 *
 * <p>A Counter's second parameter is its "width", i.e., the number of
 * bits used to represent time values. Width is indicated by including
 * the appropriate size integer type as a Counter parameter.
 *
 * <p>See TEP102 for more details.
 *
 * @param precision_tag A type indicating the precision of this Counter.
 * @param size_type An integer type representing time values for this Counter.
