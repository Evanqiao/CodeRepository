 * @param to_precision_tag A type indicating the precision of the transformed

 * @param to_size_type The type for the width of the transformed Counter.
 * @param from_precision_tag A type indicating the precision of the original

 * @param from_size_type The type for the width of the original Counter.
 * @param bit_shift_right Original time units will be 2 to the power

 * @param upper_count_type A type large enough to store the upper bits --
 *   those needed above from_size_type after its shift right to fill
