/**
 * An Alarm is a low-level interface intended for precise timing.
 *
 * <p>An Alarm is parameterised by its "precision" (milliseconds,
 * microseconds, etc), identified by a type. This prevents, e.g.,
 * unintentionally mixing components expecting milliseconds with those
 * expecting microseconds as those interfaces have a different type.
 *
 * <p>An Alarm's second parameter is its "width", i.e., the number of
 * bits used to represent time values. Width is indicated by including
 * the appropriate size integer type as an Alarm parameter.
 *
 * <p>See TEP102 for more details.
 *
 * @param precision_tag A type indicating the precision of this Alarm.
 * @param size_type An integer type representing time values for this Alarm.
