/*
 * A network trickle timer. A trickle timer has a period in the range
 * [L, H]. After firing, the period is doubled, up to H. If the period
 * is P, then the timer is scheduled to fire in the interval [0.5P, P]
 * (the second half of a period). The period can be reset to L (the
 * smallest period, and therefore the highest frequency).
 *
 * The timer may be suppressed. If a user of the interface has heard
 * enough packets from other nodes that indicate its transmitting a
 * packet would be unncessarily redundant, then the timer does not
 * fire. The timer has a constant K and a counter C. If C &gte; K, then
 * the timer does not fire. When an interval ends, C is reset to 0.
 * Calling <tt>incrementCounter</tt> increments C by one.
 *
 * For details, refer to Levis et al., "A Self-Regulating Algorithm
 * for Code Maintenance and Propagation in Wireless Sensor Networks,"
 * NSDI 2004. The component providing this interface defines the
 * constants L, H, and K.
