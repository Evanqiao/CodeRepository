/**
 * Please refer to TEP 115 for more information about this component and its
 * intended use.<br><br>
 *
 * This component povides a power management policy for managing the power
 * states of non-virtualized devices.  Non-virtualized devices are shared
 * using a parameterized Resource interface, and are powered down according
 * to some policy whenever there are no more pending requests to that Resource.
 * The policy implemented by this component is to delay the power down of a
 * device by some contant factor.  Such a policy is useful whenever a device
 * has a long wake-up latency.  The cost of waiting for the device to power
 * up can be avoided if the device is requested again before some predetermined
 * amount of time.<br><br>
 *
 * Powerdown of the device is done through the <code>SplitControl</code>
 * interface, so this component can only be used with those devices that
 * provide that interface.<br><br>
 *
 * For devices providing either the <code>AsyncStdControl</code> or
 * <code>StdControl</code> interfaces, please use either the
 * <code>AsyncStdControlDeferredPowerManagerC</code> component or the
 * <code>StdControlDeferredPowerManagerC</code> component respectively.
 *
 * @param <b>delay</b> -- The amount of time the power manager should wait
 *                        before shutting down the device once it is free.
