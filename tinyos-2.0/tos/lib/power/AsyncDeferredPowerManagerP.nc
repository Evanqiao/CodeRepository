/**
 * Please refer to TEP 115 for more information about this component and its
 * intended use.<br><br>
 *
 * This is the internal implementation of the deffered power management
 * policy for managing the power states of non-virtualized devices.
 * Non-virtualized devices are shared using a parameterized Resource
 * interface, and are powered down according to some policy whenever there
 * are no more pending requests to that Resource.  The policy implemented
 * by this component is to delay the power down of a device by some contant
 * factor.  Such a policy is useful whenever a device has a long wake-up
 * latency.  The cost of waiting for the device to power up can be
 * avoided if the device is requested again before some predetermined
 * amount of time.
 *
 * @param <b>delay</b> -- The amount of time the power manager should wait
 *                        before shutting down the device once it is free.
