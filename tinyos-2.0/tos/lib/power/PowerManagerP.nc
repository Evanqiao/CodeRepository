/**
 * Please refer to TEP 115 for more information about this component and its
 * intended use.<br><br>
 *
 * This is the internal implementation of the standard power management
 * policy for managing the power states of non-virtualized devices.
 * Non-virtualized devices are shared using a parameterized Resource
 * interface, and are powered down according to some policy whenever there
 * are no more pending requests to that Resource.  The policy implemented
 * by this component is to power down a device as soon as it becomes free.
 * Such a policy is useful whenever a device has a negligible wake-up
 * latency.  There is no cost associated with waiting for the device to
 * power up, so it can be powered on and off as often as possible.
