/**
 * This is the PrintfC component.  It provides the printf service for printing
 * data over the serial interface using the standard c-style printf command.  
 * It must be started via the SplitControl interface it provides.  Data
 * printed using printf are buffered and only sent over the serial line after
 * making a call to PrintfFlush.flush().  This buffer has a maximum size of 
 * 250 bytes at present.  After calling start on this component, printf
 * statements can be made anywhere throughout your code, so long as you include
 * the "printf.h" header file in every file you wish to use it.  Standard
 * practice is to start the printf service in the main application, and set up 
 * a timer to periodically flush the printf buffer (500ms should do).  In future
 * versions, user defined buffer sizes as well as well as automatic flushing at 
 * user defined intervals will be supported.
