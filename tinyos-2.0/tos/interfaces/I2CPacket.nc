/**
 * I2C Packet/buffer interface for sending data over the I2C bus.
 * The address, length, and buffer must be specified.  The I2C bus then
 * has control of that buffer and returns it when the operation has
 * completed.  The I2CPacket interface supports master-mode communication
 * and provides for multiple repeated STARTs and multiple reads/writes 
 * within the same START transaction. 
 * The interface is typed according to the address size supported by 
 * the master hardware.  Masters capable of supporting extended (10-bit)
 * I2C addressing MUST export both types. Applications should use the 
 * smallest address size to ensure best portability.
 *
 * @param addr_size A type indicating the slave address size. Supported
 * values are TI2CExtdAddr (for 10-bit addressing) and TI2CBasicAddr (7-bit
 * addressing).
