/**
 * SPI Packet/buffer interface for sending data over an SPI bus.  This
 * interface provides a split-phase send command which can be used for
 * sending, receiving or both. It is a "send" command because reading
 * from the SPI requires writing bytes. The send call allows NULL
 * parameters for receive or send only operations. This interface is
 * for buffer based transfers where the microcontroller is the master
 * (clocking) device.
 *
 * Often, an SPI bus must first be acquired using a Resource interface
 * before sending commands with SPIPacket. In the case of multiple
 * devices attached to a single SPI bus, chip select pins are often also
 * used.
