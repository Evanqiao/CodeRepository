This directory contains the tinyos tools that are distributed in the
tinyos-tools package, along with the spec files for all tinyos packages
(the release directory). 

To install the tinyos tools from CVS, you must first prepare the
configure scripts here and in platforms/mica/uisp:
  ./Bootstrap
  (cd platforms/mica/uisp;./bootstrap)

Then you can configure, make and install as usual:
  ./configure
  make
  make install
