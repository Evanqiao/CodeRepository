tos-storage-stm25p - Generate storage volume description code
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBtos-storage-stm25p\fR \fIplatform-directory\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBtos-storage-stm25p\fR reads a user specification describing the layout
of storage volumes on an ST M25P80 flash chip, and generates code
describing that layout for use by the TinyOS 2.0 storage subsystem.  The
user specification is in XML and is read from standard input. The code is
written to standard output.

The argument should specify the platform directory for the current
compilation target; this is necessary for the correct handling of 
file include statements in the XML input.

This program is normally invoked automatically by the TinyOS build system
when your application directory contains a \fBvolumes-stm25p.xml\fR file.
