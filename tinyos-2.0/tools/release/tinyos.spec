%description
TinyOS is an event based operating environment designed for use with 
embedded networked sensors.  It is designed to support the concurrency
intensive operations required by networked sensors while requiring minimal
hardware resources. For a full analysis and description of the
TinyOS system, its component model, and its implications for Networked
Sensor Architectures please see: "Architectural Directions for Networked
Sensors" which can be found off of http://www.tinyos.net
